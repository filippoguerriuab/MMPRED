QUERY=""
# QUERY is the fasta file for which prediction are performed.
# If BLASTPATH is specified then QUERY is aligned with TARGET 
# and the prediction is applied for the sequences from TARGET 
# that match the ones in QUERY 


ALLELES=""
# ALLELES is a 1-column txt file with the identifier of the alleles

PREDICTION_MODE=""
# PREDICTION_MODE specifies if the QUERY file contains full length protein sequences
# or small peptide/epitopes. Two possible values: "protein", "peptide". 
# If the mode "protein" is selected the program will identity a 9-mer core for each 
# window of size W of the sequence in QUERY.
# If the mode "peptide" is selected the program predict one 9-mer core for each 
# sequence in query

W="15"
# W is the window size for the prediction, default = 15


NETMHCIIPANPATH=""
# NETMHCIIPANPATH is the relative or absolute path for the folder "mhc_ii" of the
# iedb prediction program. Mandatoy to apply netmhciipan 


RESULTS_FOLDER="./results_folder_name/"
# RESULTS_FOLDER is name of the resutls folder



################## If alignment has to be performed, compile below

TARGET=""
# TARGET is the fasta file to which QUERY is aligned to

BLASTPATH=""
# relative or absolute path to the blast folder "ncbi-blast-2.12.0+/"

ALGN_FILT_PAR=""
# ALGN_FILT_PAR parameter choose to filter alignment, possible values: "evalue", "bitscore", "identity"
# if nothing is specified all the alignment are reported in the summary file

ALGN_FILT_THR=""
# ALGN_FILT_THR is the cutoff to filter the alignments, i.e. "0.05"
